To start the NUnit GUI runner directly from the IDE for debugging, set the 
"NUnitPath" environment variable to the location of your nunit.exe prior to 
starting the IDE. To set environment variables, simply right-click "My 
Computer", choose "Properties". Then you go to "Advanced" tab, and there's a 
button called "Environment Variables".
