Due to major paranoia around executing powershell scripts, the execution policy
has to be changed before being able to build the solution.

This can be done either with 

  set-executionpolicy -executionPolicy RemoteSigned

in a powershell runing as administrator or by merging one or both of

  powershell.executionpolicy.reg
  powershell.executionpolicy.wow6432.reg

depending on the bit-ness of your windows and the bit-ness of the shell your
want to use.
